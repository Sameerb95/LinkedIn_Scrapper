#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Who You Are
You are a leader who is equally comfortable developing technical solutions, solving problems across the technical and business domains, and guiding others to be successful with these solutions. You have a structured approach to problem-solving and can communicate clearly, concisely, and in simple terms. You are willing to do things differently to explore new opportunities and know how to validate potential and feasibility quickly. You are passionate about making a difference and working with teams to educate and encourage them to influence change.

Track record of success in communicating to business decision makers and executives, both in writing and speaking
BS/BA degree in Computer Science or related field; MA/MS preferred. Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Senior Staff Software Engineer - Machine Learning Acceleration,Xilinx,"Description
We are looking for a self-driven and experienced C++ software engineer to be part of the Xilinx Vitis AI Software team. The Vitis AI Software team develops core software for deploying Machine Learning applications on Xilinx Deep Learning processors.
Being a member of the Vitis AI Software team requires passion and motivation to solve challenging and technical problems with robust algorithms and features. Our code is optimized for high throughput and low-latency – core requirements for Machine Learning inference.
You will be part of a global team that works on the end-to-end Xilinx Vitis AI software stack. Our software...
starts with user Machine Learning models from popular frameworks such as Tensorflow and TVM
compiles them to target various FPGA Deep Learning accelerators
deploys them for execution on FPGA devices

The flexibility of Xilinx FPGA allows many Deep Learning accelerator designs to be deployed on the same FPGA device. And since FPGAs are programmable, Vitis AI also allows users to optimize the user’s entire end-to-end system. The FPGA can deploy not only Deep Learning accelerators on Edge and in the Cloud – it can also be combined with other modules such as Vision or Post-processing – accelerating the user’s whole application on one chip.
Because of that, you will get a unique chance to work with possibly the largest portfolio of Deep Learning accelerator Hardware, Compiler and Software designs in the industry. It is also the most flexible portfolio of Deep Learning accelerators. Xilinx FPGA makes it easy to optimize each accelerator for a specific user application. It is also easy to experiment with state-of-the-art techniques (such as quantization or pruning).
As such, Vitis-AI software is not custom code tuned for one Machine Learning application. You will join us in our exciting effort to design and implement a simple, robust and general Software Stack to efficiently deploy all current and future FPGA accelerators.
As a Sr Staff Software Engineer, you will be a core member in our global team of RTL, Compiler, Software and Application Engineers. We work together from our offices in San Jose HQ, Beijing, and Hyderabad. Because of that, good communication and teamwork are essential. This listing is for a position in our San Jose headquarters.
In this team, members are involved in all aspects of Deep Learning accelerator development: design, prototyping, implementation, testing, and productization. The team is dynamic and offers each member personal opportunity to grow their knowledge and skills in complex problem solving, product development and software engineering.
